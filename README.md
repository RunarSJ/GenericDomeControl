# GenericDomeControl
A generic observatory dome control system with arduino environment in mind

Note: I am in no regard an experienced programmer, all code are used at your own risk. This is a continuation of a firmware I made earlier for my local astronomy club. No code is released as it's currently being written. 
I lost the original source code that's in use now, and took it upon myself to get a better understanding of the C/C++ programming languages.
